# TRENCADIS -- Towards a gRid ENvironment to proCess and shAre DIcom objectS

TRENCADIS is a Grid infrastructure to store and to process large amounts of medical images and its associated data in DICOM objects.

This system enables radiologists to effectively group, search and manipulate images and structured reports in order to relate clinical findings and to be of practical value in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. 

TRENCADIS infrastructures can be deployed using virtualization and Cloud computing techniques. The platform avoids intrusive deployment of services to reduce the amount of effort required to install and maintain new TRENCADIS services. Also, it provides mechanisms to monitor and handle performance and reliability requirements by elastically provisioning computational resources from the Cloud to cope with increased demand of the platform.
