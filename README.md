# TRENCADIS -- Towards a gRid ENvironment to proCess and shAre DIcom objectS

TRENCADIS is a Grid infrastructure to store and to process large amounts
of medical images and its associated data in DICOM objects.

This system enables radiologists to effectively group, search and manipulate
images and structured reports in order to relate clinical findings and to
be of practical value in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. 

It allows the deployment of TRENCADIS infrastructures using virtualization
and Cloud computing techniques. The platform avoids intrusive deployment
of services to reduce the amount of effort required to install and
maintain new TRENCADIS services. Also, it provides mechanisms to monitor
and handle performance and reliability requirements by elastically
provisioning computational resources from the Cloud to cope with increased
demand of the platform.
